# GitHub Actions Dataset

This repository contains a curated dataset of GitHub Actions workflows and a corresponding set of concise, human-readable questions about their functionality. The dataset is designed to be a high-quality resource for training and evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in the domain of GitHub Actions, YAML syntax, and software automation.

## üöÄ Purpose & Vision

The goal of this project is to create a valuable, open-source dataset that enables the development of specialized LLMs capable of:

  * **Understanding GitHub Actions:** Answering questions about what a specific workflow does or what triggers it.
  * **Code Generation:** Generating new, functional GitHub Actions workflows based on a natural language prompt.
  * **Error Correction & Explanation:** Identifying and explaining issues within a workflow YAML.

This dataset serves as the foundational data for such projects, providing a unique "question and answer" format where the "answer" is the raw YAML code itself.

## üíæ Dataset Structure

The dataset is stored in a series of JSON files within the `datasets/` directory. Each file, e.g., `datasets/dataset_1.json`, contains a list of objects.

Each object represents a single data point and has the following structure:

| Key            | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question`     | A concise, single-sentence question about the workflow's purpose, generated by an LLM (Gemini).                                           |
| `answer`       | The raw YAML content of the GitHub Actions workflow file.                                                                                |
| `source`       | The full GitHub repository name where the workflow was found (e.g., `octocat/Spoon-Knife`).                                              |
| `path`         | The file path to the workflow within the source repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`).                                         |
| `url`          | A direct URL to the workflow file on GitHub.                                                                                             |
| `retrieved_at` | The timestamp (ISO 8601 format) indicating when this data point was collected.                                                           |

## ü§ñ How the Dataset is Generated

The dataset is automatically populated by a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on a daily schedule. This process involves three main steps:

1.  **GitHub Code Search:** The workflow searches GitHub for recent and popular `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `.yaml` files.
2.  **LLM Question Generation:** For each unique workflow file, a prompt is sent to the Gemini API (`gemini-2.0-flash`). The LLM is instructed to generate a single, concise question that describes the workflow's purpose.
3.  **Data Storage:** The generated question and the raw workflow content are saved as a new data point in a JSON file in this repository.

This automated approach ensures the dataset is continuously growing with new, relevant, and diverse examples from the open-source community.

## ü§ù Contribution & Usage

This dataset is open to the public and can be used for any research or development purpose.

  * **Training LLMs:** Download the JSON files and use them as a training set for fine-tuning a model to understand GitHub Actions.
  * **Evaluation:** The question-answer format makes this dataset a perfect tool for evaluating the performance of LLMs on GitHub Actions-related tasks.

We welcome contributions in the form of pull requests that improve the data collection process, enhance the prompt engineering, or fix issues with existing data.
