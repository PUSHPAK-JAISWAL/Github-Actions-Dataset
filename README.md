# GitHub Actions Dataset for LLM Training

## üåü An Open-Source Dataset for Training LLMs on GitHub Workflows

This repository provides a continually growing, open-source dataset of GitHub Actions workflows and a corresponding set of concise, AI-generated questions about their functionality. The dataset is specifically designed to be a high-quality resource for researchers and developers to train and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on the nuanced domain of software automation, CI/CD, and YAML configuration.

## üöÄ The Vision: A Community-Driven Resource

The goal of this project is to foster the creation of powerful, specialized LLMs for software development. By providing this dataset, we aim to enable the open-source community to build models that can:

  * **Explain Workflows:** Accurately describe the purpose and behavior of a GitHub Actions workflow from its YAML code.
  * **Generate Code:** Create new, secure, and functional workflows from a simple natural language prompt.
  * **Debug & Enhance:** Identify potential issues, security vulnerabilities, or areas for improvement within existing workflows.

This dataset is our contribution to that vision, providing the foundational "question and answer" data needed to train and fine-tune these next-generation tools.

## üíæ Dataset Contents & Structure

The dataset is stored in a series of JSON files located in the `datasets/` directory. The files are organized to be easily parsable for machine learning pipelines.

Each data point is a JSON object with the following schema:

| Key            | Description                                                                                                                              |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question`     | A single, concise, and context-rich question about the workflow's purpose. These questions are generated by the Gemini API (`gemini-1.5-flash`) to ensure high quality. |
| `answer`       | The raw YAML content of the GitHub Actions workflow file. This serves as the "ground truth" for the `question`.                         |
| `source`       | The full GitHub repository name where the workflow was originally found (e.g., `octocat/Spoon-Knife`).                                   |
| `path`         | The relative file path to the workflow within its source repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/main.yml`).                               |
| `url`          | A direct link to the workflow file on GitHub. This is useful for manual inspection or for verifying the source.                         |
| `retrieved_at` | A timestamp in ISO 8601 format, showing when the data point was collected.                                                               |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the Data is Collected

The repository's content is managed by an automated GitHub Actions workflow that runs on a daily schedule. This workflow is the core engine of the project and works as follows:

1.  It performs a search across GitHub for active and widely-used workflow files.
2.  It retrieves the content of each file.
3.  Using the `google-generativeai` library, it generates a single, simple question for each workflow's content.
4.  The new question/answer pair is appended to the latest dataset file.

This process ensures that the dataset remains fresh and relevant. The data collection script is also available in the `scripts/` directory for full transparency.

## ü§ù Contribution & Community
